# What's Changed

## Bulk Edit items in the Multiple Download Card #817

Now you can select a subset of the items in the multiple download card and apply changes only to them.
- Select items between 2 items
- Write down item indexes to select
- remove items
- Invert selected
- All options in this screen that previously could apply to all items are implemented for this function.

Also if you select a sublist and try to update formats and decide to update in the background, the app will remember the other items you didnt select when you return back to it but only the selected items will have their formats updated of course.

## For advanced users:

For anyone who is using intent arguments in YTDLnis for automation, the COMMAND argument has been removed. This is due to a found security vulnerability by SonarPaul where user information and app integrity could be compromised. Read the pdf for more information in the YTDLnis Updates Telegram Channel.

If you were using that argument for extra commands with audio/video downloads, you could make a command template about it and use it as extra command and also add a url regex if you want.
