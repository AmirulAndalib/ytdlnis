# What's Changed

- Fixed downloads crashing on items with titles that have quotes in them
- Removed custom format sorting by default to avoid common issues with format selection, and moved the preferences to advanced settings. Most of users don't need to customize sorting formats anyway :)
- Fixed app sometimes building -f as bv/bv+ba/b instead of bv+ba/bv/b
- Update WorkManager library, hopefully fixing #720
- Looks like adding preferred language in -S is useless so i added it as part of ba[lang^=...]
- Other small things

## Note

The alternate downloader Aria2c is broken, so turn it off for the time being until something is found out how to fix it/

Hopefully this build is stable for the time being!
